# R2.1-001 本体建模流程重构 Delivery Record

- Requirement source: `docs/requirements/requirements-v2.1.md` R2.1-001
- Status: 待细化；本次只完成从 R2.0-003 的版本迁移与背景记录
- Started: 2026-07-23T17:11:19+08:00
- Last updated: 2026-07-23T17:11:19+08:00
- Worktree baseline: `1dc5d54` (Pause R2.0-002 and record ontology workflow rethink)
- Design: not created; final process is intentionally not frozen
- Shared test plan: not created; acceptance contract is intentionally not frozen

## Initial context

- Current state: R2.0-002 is paused at its Pi Runtime/real-run checkpoint. Its original knowledge-
  graph-oriented workflow has not completed merge, review, apply, post-apply verification, Claude
  retirement, or final independent PASS.
- Target state: refine an ontology-centered modeling workflow without equating document knowledge-
  graph construction with ontology modeling completion.
- Dependencies: v1.0 semantic platform boundary; v1.1 modeling-workflow evidence; R2.0-002 Pi Runtime
  checkpoint and its real-run evidence.
- Non-goals: no final workflow design, implementation, acceptance criteria, Claude retirement, or
  automatic continuation of R2.0-002 is authorized by this migration.

## Decision history

### 2026-07-23T17:11:19+08:00 — Migrate R2.0-003 to v2.1 — main agent + user

- Context: R2.0-003 was recorded in v2.0 only as a background placeholder after R2.0-002 was paused.
  The user requested that the requirement belong to v2.1 instead.
- Action/decision: Remove R2.0-003 from `requirements-v2.0.md`; create v2.1 R2.1-001 with the same
  name, background, current directions, and unresolved refinement topics. Update v2.0 and the
  R2.0-002 record to reference R2.1-001.
- Evidence: `docs/requirements/requirements-v2.0.md`; commit `1dc5d54`; R2.0-002 delivery record.
- Outcome/next step: R2.1-001 remains `待细化`. Begin collaborative functional refinement only when the
  user asks to determine the final ontology modeling workflow.
